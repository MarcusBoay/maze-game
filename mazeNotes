Idea: two player maze game, where one person navigates maze, other person moves to block said person from goal

Player 1 uses keyboard
Player 2 uses mouse
Mouse click blacks out a grid square

To implement:
    - GUI?
    - Using Pygame
    - Initialize the grid array!
        - Easy: use a for loop:
            grid = [[0]*gridnum for n in range(gridnum)]
                - The reason I chose to use '0' as a value for the grids is because 0 can represent an empty cell; we can then set a player to be a value of 2, perhaps, and walls can be represented by a 1 or -1. The end can be another 9.
            grid_y = height/gridnum
            grid_x = width/gridnum

    - Keyboard functionality
    - Character image
    - Grid interaction
        -  Figure out width/height of screen, figure out grid size based on that (divide screen by 10x10, do that)
        - 

A Player Object:
    - must have y,x values
    - must move per grid value
