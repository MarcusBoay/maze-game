Idea: two player maze game, where one person navigates maze, other person moves to block said person from goal

Player 1 uses keyboard
Player 2 uses mouse
Mouse click blacks out a grid square

To implement:

    - Initialize the grid array!
    - Keyboard functionality
    - Character image
    - Grid interaction
